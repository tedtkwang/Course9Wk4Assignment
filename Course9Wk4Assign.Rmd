## Executive Summary

The data set, mtcars, was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).  
  
This presentation contains a Shiny App that let's you 1) select any set of data points on a graph and 2) fit a linear regression model on those data points.
